    description:
      'Exception handling in Java is a fundamental practice for dealing with errors and exceptional conditions during the execution of a program.

    description:
      'Microservice is an architectural approach in which an application is divided into small independent services that work autonomously and collaboratively. Each service, or microservice, has a specific purpose and can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. This approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance of the overall system. Furthermore, microservices can be implemented using different technologies, which increases modularity and facilitates system evolution over time. However, communication between microservices is essential and is usually done through well-defined APIs.',
